1. Always check if components from the Figma design already exist in the project—**reuse them** instead of creating new ones.
2. Follow the existing **code style** and formatting conventions of the project.
3. Use the correct **naming conventions** for components, variables, and files.
4. Apply accurate **units** for dimensions and spacing as per the design.
5. Use the **correct project color palette**—do not improvise colors.
6. **IMPORTANT:** Never alter the UI design during API integration unless explicitly instructed.
7. Before implementation, **download the Figma files** and review them thoroughly.
8. Write code as an experienced software engineer familiar with the project’s tech stack and framework.
9. Use **ShadCN components** where applicable; if not available, install the required component.
10. Always verify the **props and usage** of each existing component—**do not assume default values are correct**.
11. **Repeat:** When implementing API integrations, **do not modify the UI design** in any way unless requested.
12. Use the existing `axiosInstance` with **`react-query`’s `useQuery` and `useMutation`** hooks for all API operations.
13. Adhere to the best practices and conventions of the **latest version of Next.js**.
14. Use ShadCN components for UI construction where appropriate and consistent with the design.
15. **Download UI assets** (icons, images, etc.) from Figma, move them to the `/public` folder, and reference them in the code.
16. **IMPORTANT:** Do not change or modify UI elements **outside the scope of your assigned implementation**.
17. Break down every figma design into components and fit them into the intended page.
